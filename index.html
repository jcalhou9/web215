			<p>Welcome to my website. Here, you'll find a selection of my work 
				and projects as I explore technology and programming. I've put
				together this site to share the various things I've been working on 
				and the ideas I've been developing along the way.</p>
			<p>I’m excited about the future and look forward to tackling new challenges and expanding 
				my knowledge. Feel free to explore and see where I'm headed next. You can

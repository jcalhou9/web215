			<h2>Contract</h2>
				<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Jeremy Calhoun</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in 
					my Spring 2025 WEB215-N801: Adv Web Markup and Scripting with 
					my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
				<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly 
					available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for
					schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
				<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing
					up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
				<p>Signed: <i>Jeremy Calhoun, 01/17/2025</i></p>
